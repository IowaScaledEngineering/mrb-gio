Commands:
readPins (C R)
Read pin state of all pins.
Returns (c r pin[15:0])

writePins (C W port[15:0])
Writes port word to outputs.  Only affects pins configured as output.  Does
NOT set/clear pull-up state (that is determined in EEPROM).
Returns (c w port[15:0])

Outgoing Packets:
status - (S pin[15:0])
Sends pin state of all pins.  Triggered periodically (if configured in
EEPROM) and upon input pin state change if in status trigger mode (see
below).



EEPROM:
0x00 - 0x0F: Standard MRBus

0x10: ddr - Data direction mask (0 = input, 1 = output) high-byte
0x11: " low byte
0x12: pull - Pull-up mask (0 = disabled, 1 = enabled), only applies to inputs, high byte
0x13: " low byte
0x14: trigger - Trigger type upon input change (0 = status, 1 = command), only applies to inputs

0x20: debouncePin0 - debounce for Pin 0 (0 = disabled, 1-255 = varying degrees of debounce)
0x21: debouncePin1
...
0x2F: debouncePin16


Command Packets for trigger = command mode.

(src and 'C' are implied.  crc is calculated.)

0x100 - 0x10F: Command Packet for Pin0 = 0 (dest len data1 ... data14)
0x110 - 0x11F: Command Packet for Pin0 = 1
0x120 - 0x12F: Command Packet for Pin1 = 0 (dest len data1 ... data14)
0x130 - 0x13F: Command Packet for Pin1 = 1
...
0x2E0 - 0x2EF: Command Packet for Pin15 = 0 (dest len data1 ... data14)
0x2F0 - 0x2FF: Command Packet for Pin15 = 1
